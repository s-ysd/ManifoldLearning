# ManifoldLearning
This repository is for uploading notebooks which try to understand galaxy evolution using manifold learning.

2019/07/03 : Look at "DataCheckAndSampleSelectionFromGAMA.ipynb" for checking my result.

2019/07/18 : I have done completed samples and uploaded for everyone to try classification and manifold learning.

2019/08/16 : I have completed rcsed.fits file for the classification (CompleteSDSSForManifoldLearning.ipynb). In this file, I did the volume limited selection up to z=0.2.
